# About Swine Reader

Swine Inc. decided to hire me to build an App `Swine Reader` for their members. To justify my salary, I need to start programming right away. However, unfortunately, product spec, product design, and back-end server are not finalized yet. In this case where should I start as an iOS developer?

### Disclaimer

This project is for demostration purpose only. The word Swine suggests it has something to do with `Swinject`, a `Swift` `Dependency Injection` framework. The author is not actually hired by Swine Inc.
